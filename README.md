Simple Shell Project

In this Project, I was able to understand c quite better and also i coded from the scratch.
A shell is a command line that is used to interact with the GUI.

We interact with a shell using commands.
 commands are files.
When a command is given, the  shell does the following :
1. Recieve the Command
2. Read The command
3. interpret(Search for the directories files relating to the command)
4. Finally Execute the command.

Commands can either be a Built-in Command or Executable commands

Thank ALX for this Opportunity
